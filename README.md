🌍 Earthquake EDA: Exploring Magnitude, Depth & Trends
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global earthquake data to uncover insights related to magnitude, depth, and temporal/geographic patterns. The dataset used covers seismic activities worldwide over a recent week.

📌 Project Objectives
Analyze earthquake data from recent events.

Identify regions with the highest earthquake frequency.

Understand magnitude and depth distribution.

Explore daily occurrence trends.

Investigate correlations among key variables (e.g., magnitude, depth, location).

Visualize data using graphs and geospatial plots.

📂 Dataset Information
Source: USGS Earthquake Map

Attributes:

Magnitude – Earthquake intensity

Depth – Depth of the quake (in km)

Time – Timestamp of the event

Latitude and Longitude – Location coordinates

Region – Nearest known location

🧰 Technologies & Libraries
Python

Pandas – Data handling

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

Jupyter Notebook

📊 EDA Highlights
Histograms for magnitude and depth distribution

Line plot for daily earthquake count

Bar and Pie Charts for top 10 earthquake regions

Scatter plot for magnitude vs. depth

Correlation Matrix with heatmap

Box plots to identify outliers

Geospatial maps of earthquake locations

🔍 Key Findings
Most earthquakes are shallow and have a low magnitude.

High-frequency regions include the Pacific Ring of Fire, Alaska, and California.

No strong correlation was found between depth and magnitude.

Daily earthquake events show consistent patterns with minor fluctuations.

Significant outliers may indicate potentially hazardous seismic events.

🚀 Future Scope
Real-time monitoring with USGS APIs

Clustering with K-Means or DBSCAN for region grouping

Predictive modeling of earthquake probability

Time-series forecasting using ARIMA or Prophet

Interactive dashboards with Streamlit or Power BI
